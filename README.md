# Key Challenges Faced

I faced the most difficulty working with CSS Grid and building the hero section using only HTML and CSS. I have been working with React for a long time and I usually prefer Flexbox, so creating layouts with pure Grid felt unfamiliar and introduced multiple issues.

Key difficulties:
Laying out the hero section exactly as the design required using Grid (alignments, responsive breakpoints, and overlap behavior).
Translating a design I usually implement with React components into standalone HTML/CSS.
Mobile responsiveness and the hamburger/mobile-nav behavior required extra tweaks and testing.

Additional context:
I had a time limit for recording and uploading my progress, so I split the video into two parts. Because of that and some technical issues, I was unable to record and upload the full process in one video.
- Despite the challenges, I gave my full effort and worked honestly to complete the task.
